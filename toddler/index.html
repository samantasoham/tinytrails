                <h2><i>Our approach to early education for Toddlers (1 year to 3 years old)</i> </h2>
                <p> By this stage, a child‚Äôs leg muscles are ready‚Äîonce they stand up and take those first steps, they‚Äôre off and running, eager to explore. Our Toddler education program offers them the opportunity to do so in safety and also allows them to develop cognitive skills as they build language, graduate to one to two-word sentences, learn to hold a crayon and eat finger foods.
                </p>
                <p> This stage also marks‚ÄØthe beginning of a child‚Äôs potty-training journey.‚ÄØOur caregivers frequently ask each child if they have to go to the restroom, and then guides them through the process. Before you know it, you have a potty-trained child.
                </p>
                <p> Our curriculum helps Toddlers explore, and it nurtures their increasing need to communicate. By this point in their early childhood development, Toddlers have expanded their language skills, and our curriculum helps to enhance their ability to communicate verbally.
