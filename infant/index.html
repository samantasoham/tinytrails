                <h2><i>Our approach to Infant development (6 weeks to 1 year old)</i> </h2>
                <p> During infancy, children begin developing motor skills, 
                    engaging in tummy time, and learning through interactive 
                    experiences with their caregivers. Our infant caregivers utilize 
                    this crucial period to focus on stretching exercises, leg movements,
                    and fostering hand-eye coordination, helping children build a strong 
                    foundation for the next stages of early childhood development.
                </p>
                <p> As children progress into late infancy, our caregivers focus on 
                    strengthening their core muscles. At this stage, they begin learning
                    to crawl, express emotions, and coordinate their leg and arm movements.
                    Cognitively, they start to identify and recognize familiar faces, 
                    such as family members and caregivers, when they enter the room. 
                    Additionally, they begin producing those delightful early babbling 
                    sounds that everyone cherishes.

                <p>In this program, infants are introduced to basic sign language, learning to communicate needs such as asking for 'more' or indicating they are 'all done' with their caregivers in the classroom and with their parents at home. This is a valuable skill, as it allows children to express their wants and needs, reducing frustration!</p>
