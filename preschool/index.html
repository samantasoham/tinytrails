                <h2><i>Our approach to Preschool Education (3 years to 5 years old)</i> </h2>
                <p> Preschoolers â€¯are growing upâ€”potty trained and ready to conquer the world! At this stage, they absorb all of the information around them and are eager to master the new skills they acquire. Thatâ€™s why we equip our Preschooler's classrooms with challenging equipment and toys to help satisfy the childrenâ€™s appetite for knowledge.
                </p>
                <p> Our Preschools are broken up into three completely separate classes according to chronological age andâ€¯developmental stage. â€¯We do this to provide an environment where children can be independent and exercise a variety of personal, social, and emotional skills with children at similar stages of development.
